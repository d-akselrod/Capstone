\section{System Description}

\subsection{Informal Description (if time permits)}

\subsection{System Context}

\subsubsection{Users}
At the heart of the system lie the users of the application. Users are a diverse group of individuals and interact with the SweatSmart app to access workout plans, track progress, and receive guidance on their fitness journey. Users are further categorized in section 2.4 “Stakeholders” so we will not go into detail here, but it is important to mention users when discussing context.

\subsubsection{Social Media Platforms}
We recognize how important social media is for the average person’s fitness journey. SweatSmart will need to utilize this excellent resource to help motivate our users and promote the app in the process. Users should be able to easily share progress updates and workouts they enjoyed to social media sites like Instagram, X (formerly Twitter), and Facebook.

\subsubsection{External Data Sources}
SweatSmart will need to harness the power and information of external data sources to enrich its functionality and provide a comprehensive data set for its ML model. Resources like fitness blogs, articles, research papers, nutritional databases, and much more will help the application deliver up-to-date health and fitness information.

\subsubsection{Fitness Equipment and Wearables (Future Integration)}
The current fitness market is full of wearable technologies that help track an extensive set of metrics to help people on their health and fitness journeys. Integration with wearable technology will allow for a more robust user experience with workouts seamlessly synchronized in real-time. Fitness equipment has also become more advanced, with features in equipment like free weights, stationary bikes, and treadmills, which enable users to accurately track their workouts. SweatSmart would see positive user engagement from integration with these devices.

\subsection{User Characteristics}
Users will have varying levels of fitness experience and knowledge. Users might be beginners at the gym who are looking to start their fitness journey, regular gym-goers who are looking to improve their workouts, or highly experienced fitness enthusiasts who would like to track their workouts. Users should have a basic understanding of how to use a smartphone or tablet. It is expected that users will already be familiar with downloading an application, opening an application, and navigating using a touch-screen device. It is important to note that this list is not comprehensive, but it helps illustrate the types of basic functions we expect our users to be familiar with before opening our application. Users will not require any formal training to be able to operate the system.

\subsection{Problem Description}
The fitness industry has seen a remarkable explosion in interest recently due to a variety of factors. However, many challenges still persist for individuals seeking effective fitness solutions despite the increase in popularity.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item One-Size-Fits-All Approach: Traditional fitness regimens often adopt this kind of approach, providing generic workout plans that do not consider the individuality of those seeking guidance.
  \item Lack of Personalization: Many apps offer limited means of personalization, resulting in user disengagement due to plans that fail to align with each individual’s needs and goals.
  \item Guidance Gaps: Users, namely beginners, frequently encounter gaps in guidance. This makes it challenging to understand proper exercise technique, safety measures, and what progress should look like.
  \item Motivation and Accountability: Staying accountable and motivated on a fitness journey is difficult without support and commitment to some sort of community.
  \item Complexity and Information Overload: Existing fitness apps and other solutions may overwhelm users with extensive data, metrics, and features, making the fitness experience too complex to be accessible.
\end{enumerate}

In summary, the current fitness landscape sees a lack of effective and personalized options for users, leading to less-than-ideal fitness outcomes and an overall lack of engagement.

\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}

The information in this section will be used to evaluate the team members on the
graduate attribute of Lifelong Learning.  Please answer the following questions:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item What knowledge and skills will the team collectively need to acquire to
  successfully complete this capstone project?  Examples of possible knowledge
  to acquire include domain specific knowledge from the domain of your
  application, or software engineering knowledge, mechatronics knowledge or
  computer science knowledge.  Skills may be related to technology, or writing,
  or presentation, or team management, etc.  You should look to identify at
  least one item for each team member.\\

Fitness and Health Domain:\\
Understanding the fitness and health domain, including workout planning, nutrition, and exercise physiology, is essential for designing effective and personalized fitness solutions.

Machine Learning:\\
Our team will need to gain expertise in ML and AI methodologies in order to develop SweatSmart. To train the AI model, we first need to collect quantitative and qualitative data. Using the data, we can build and train the algorithm to generate personalized workouts.

Mobile App Development:\\
Mastery of mobile app development for iOS will be necessary for our team. We plan on using React to develop the front-end and .NET for the back end. All team members will need to learn and/or refine knowledge in these development tools for this project to be successful.

UI/UX Design:\\
Understanding key principles of user interface and user experience design to create intuitive, visually appealing, and user-friendly interfaces will be important. We will use Figma to visualize pages of our app, making it more efficient to code.

Database Management:\\
Skills in database design, data storage, and retrieval are needed to manage user accounts, workout plans, and progress data securely.

  \item For each of the knowledge areas and skills identified in the previous
  question, what are at least two approaches to acquiring the knowledge or
  mastering the skill?  Of the identified approaches, which will each team
  member pursue, and why did they make this choice?


\textbf{Fitness Domain Research:}\\
Team Members: Sam and Jonny

To ensure a comprehensive understanding of fitness practices, we will conduct research by:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Reading at least 5 peer-reviewed articles on the latest fitness practices.
    \item Exploring 10 or more fitness-related blogs each.
    \item Analyzing 3 or more existing fitness applications/websites each.
\end{itemize}

This extensive research will provide us with diverse insights into the current fitness landscape, allowing us to make informed decisions during app development.

\textbf{Consultation with Fitness Experts:}\\
Team Members: Sophie and Daniel

We will consult with fitness experts, including those at McMaster University's kinesiology department, McMaster personal trainers, and potentially faculty members from the Physiotherapy department. This step is crucial for gaining insights and guidance from primary sources who are experts in the field of fitness.

\textbf{Machine Learning Skill Development:}\\
To gain proficiency in machine learning, we will:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Utilize online resources for learning how to create and train AI algorithms.
    \item Seek assistance from professors and industry experts in the field.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Mobile App Development:}\\

To enhance our mobile app development skills, we will:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Develop a simple, bare-bones app to practice fundamental functions using React and .Net. (Team Members: Sophie Fillion, Sam McDonald). This will be suefil practice to ensure we understand all basic functions and practices for developing a mobile application using React and .Net. 
    \item Practice writing code for mobile platforms (Team Members: Jonny and Daniel). We are already familiar with React and .Net for mobile development, so we will write smaller practice sections and assist Sophie and Sam in developing their basic apps, serving as mentors to ensure a strong understanding of these frameworks.
