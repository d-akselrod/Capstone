\plt{Reflection is an important component of getting the full benefits from a
learning experience.  Besides the intrinsic benefits of reflection, this
document will be used to help the TAs grade how well your team responded to
feedback.  In addition, several CEAB (Canadian Engineering Accreditation Board)
Learning Outcomes (LOs) will be assessed based on your reflections.}

\section{Changes in Response to Feedback}

\plt{Summarize the changes made over the course of the project in response to
feedback from TAs, the instructor, teammates, other teams, the project
supervisor (if present), and from user testers.}

\plt{For those teams with an external supervisor, please highlight how the feedback 
from the supervisor shaped your project.  In particular, you should highlight the 
supervisor's response to your Rev 0 demonstration to them.}

\subsection{Software Requirements Specification (SRS)}
Post-Rev 0, significant refinements were made to the SRS document. Early feedback pointed towards the necessity for a more user-centric approach, which led us to pivot from an AI model to an evidence-based algorithm for workout generation. The SRS was updated to reflect this fundamental change, focusing on the accuracy and reliability of the workout data provided.

Incorporating insights from kinesiology experts, the SRS was restructured to emphasize simplicity and evidence-based practices over predictive machine learning, aligning the app's core functionalities more closely with scientifically-backed fitness principles. This shift in approach resulted in the enhancement of user profiles, allowing for more personalized and adaptable workout plans.

\subsection{Hazard Analysis}
The Hazard Analysis document underwent a comprehensive update to assess the risks associated with the new direction of our project. With the transition to evidence-based content, we meticulously reviewed potential hazards related to incorrect workout information, user data security, and the physical safety of our users.

We integrated robust validation mechanisms to safeguard against the dissemination of harmful fitness advice and implemented more stringent security protocols for user data. Our revised hazard analysis also stressed the importance of educating users on safe workout practices to mitigate the risk of injury, a concern that was repeatedly echoed by our project supervisor.

\subsection{Supervisor Feedback Integration}
Feedback from our supervisor was especially influential after the Rev 0 demo. Our supervisor emphasized the need for workouts tailored to individual capabilities and the potential risks associated with generic fitness plans. This led us to refine our algorithm to accommodate user feedback and physiological data more effectively.

Moreover, the supervisor's insights into the healthcare implications of resistance training propelled us to prioritize user health outcomes in our design considerations. This translated into a heightened focus on workout variety, recovery, and adaptability within the app.

In conclusion, the iterative feedback process not only optimized the SweatSmart app for better performance but also aligned it more closely with the end-users' health and fitness objectives.

\section{Design Decisions}

Throughout the development of SweatSmart, our design decisions were critically informed by a combination of project constraints, assumptions, and user-centered design principles. This section explains how these factors shaped the final product.

\paragraph{Embracing Constraints}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Our initial ambition to employ an AI-driven model for workout generation was limited by the constraints of data availability and project timeline. This led to a pivot towards an evidence-based approach, grounded in established exercise science.
    \item The feedback from our supervisor, Dr. Stuart Philips, and his insights on fitness simplicity, directly influenced the simplification of the app’s functionalities, aligning with the needs of our target audience — individuals new to fitness.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Navigating Assumptions}
\begin{itemize}
    \item We assumed our users required a degree of customization in their workout plans. This was validated through usability testing and incorporated into the design as adjustable workout parameters.
    \item It was presumed that integrating social features for community engagement would enhance user retention, an assumption that was borne out during the user feedback sessions.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Constraints as Direction}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Limitations in technical expertise necessitated the choice of a more familiar tech stack, which proved to be efficient for rapid development and allowed for a greater focus on user experience.
    \item Budgetary constraints led to prioritizing the most impactful features that could be implemented without compromising quality.
