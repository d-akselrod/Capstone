    \section{Problem Statement}

    In our current fast-paced world, it has become increasingly difficult for people of all fitness levels to maintain a healthy and active lifestyle without investing significant time into creating a plan and routine. Consequently, many individuals struggle to establish and follow personalized workout plans that match their experience, preferences, goals, and tight schedules. Market-available options often fail to provide adaptive and evolving workouts, leading to stagnation, reduced motivation, and boredom. Addressing these challenges, our team proposes the development of an evidence-based workout planner app.

    \subsection{Problem}

    The prevailing issue is the absence of effective, customizable solutions that allow individuals to generate and adhere to fitness plans tailored to their unique goals, experience, preferences, and schedules. Current workout planners tend to be generic and rigid, resulting in suboptimal fitness outcomes and dwindling user motivation.

        \item Questions/prompts from users
    \end{itemize}

    \noindent\textbf{Outputs:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Customized workout plans
        \item Recommended exercises with set counts
        \item Workout intensity and duration guidelines
        \item Progress monitoring and user-specific workout statistics
        \item Motivational features
        \item Tailored responses to user queries
    \end{itemize}
