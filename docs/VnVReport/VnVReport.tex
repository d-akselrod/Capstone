\section{\textbf{General Information}}

\subsection{Summary}

This document outlines the Verification and Validation (V\&V) plan for SweatSmart, an AI workout application. The purpose of this V\&V plan is to detail the methodologies, processes, and activities employed to ensure that SweatSmart meets the requirements laid out in our team’s software requirements specification (SRS) document.

\subsection{Objectives}

The primary objectives of this plan are as follows: \newline

\textbf{Verification: }To ensure that the algorithms, user interfaces, data model, and other design elements of the application align with the intended specifications. \newline

\textbf{Validation: }To ascertain that when users utilize SweatSmart in their daily workouts, they experience the promised personalized touch, and the app contributes positively to their fitness journey. We also aim to validate that on the technical side, the application is working as expected and as we plan on from the beginning. \newline

\textbf{User Experience Assurance: }While the technical aspects of the application are of utmost importance, this plan also seeks to verify and validate the intuitiveness, ease of navigation, and overall user satisfaction derived from using the application. \newline

\textbf{Data Integrity and Privacy: }Given the sensitivity of health and fitness data, a crucial reason for this V\&V plan is to ensure that data collection, storage, and processing adhere to the required standards of security and privacy. \newline

\textbf{Continuous Feedback and Improvement: }To set up a mechanism that gathers useful user feedback, ensuring that any discrepancies, issues, or potential improvements are identified during the V\&V process so they can be addressed before or during rollout of the application. \newline

\subsection{Relevant Documentation}

The main supporting document for this V\&V plan is our Software Requirements Specification which enumerates the features, functionalities, and performance requirements that SweatSmart must adhere to.

the supervisor (when one exists) shaped the final product.  In particular 
the feedback from the Rev 0 demo to the supervisor (or to potential users) 
should be highlighted.}

\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}

The information in this section will be used to evaluate the team members on the
graduate attribute of Reflection.  Please answer the following question:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item In what ways was the Verification and Validation (VnV) Plan different
  from the activities that were actually conducted for VnV?  If there were
  differences, what changes required the modification in the plan?  Why did
  these changes occur?  Would you be able to anticipate these changes in future
  projects?  If there weren't any differences, how was your team able to clearly
  predict a feasible amount of effort and the right tasks needed to build the
  evidence that demonstrates the required quality?  (It is expected that most
  teams will have had to deviate from their original VnV Plan.)
\end{enumerate}
