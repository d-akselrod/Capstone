\section{Introduction}

This document presents the Module Interface Specifications (MIS) for \textbf{SweatSmart}, a fitness application designed to provide evidence-based workout plans using predictive analytics based on user data and methods proven through exercise science. \textit{SweatSmart} aims to lift the veil of mystery from the exercise world and enable people of all ages with little workout experience to infiltrate the market with a straightforward approach to fitness and workout prescriptions.

\subsection{Complementary Documents}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{System Requirement Specifications (SRS)}: This document outlines the detailed functional and non-functional requirements that \textit{SweatSmart} is designed to fulfill.
    \item \textbf{Module Guide (MG)}: The MG provides an overview of the systemâ€™s architecture, describing how different modules within \textit{SweatSmart} interact and work together to achieve the application's objectives.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Repository and Implementation}
The complete documentation, including implementation details, source code, and additional resources for \textit{SweatSmart}, is maintained and regularly updated in our repository. This can be accessed at: \url{https://github.com/d-akselrod/SweatSmart/}.

This MIS document is structured to give a clear understanding of each module within \textit{SweatSmart}, focusing on the interfaces they expose and the interactions they have with each other. By defining these interfaces explicitly, the MIS ensures that any changes or enhancements to individual modules can be made with a comprehensive understanding of their impact on the overall system.

Throughout the development and maintenance of \textit{SweatSmart}, this document will serve as a key reference to ensure consistency, modularity, and scalability in the application's architecture.


\section{Notation}
The structure of the MIS for modules comes from \textit{HoffmanAndStrooper1995},
with the addition that template modules have been adapted from
\textit{GhezziEtAl2003}.  The mathematical notation comes from Chapter 3 of
\textit{HoffmanAndStrooper1995}.  For instance, the symbol := is used for a
multiple assignment statement and conditional rules follow the form $(c_1
\Rightarrow r_1 | c_2 \Rightarrow r_2 | ... | c_n \Rightarrow r_n )$.

The following table summarizes the primitive data types used by \progname. 

\begin{center}
\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.2}
\noindent 
\begin{tabular}{l l p{7.5cm}} 
\toprule 
\textbf{Data Type} & \textbf{Notation} & \textbf{Description}\\ 
\midrule
boolean & bool & a result of true or false\\
character & char & a single symbol or digit\\
integer & $\mathbb{Z}$ & a number without a fractional component in (-$\infty$, $\infty$) \\
natural number & $\mathbb{N}$ & a number without a fractional component in [1, $\infty$) \\
sequence & seq & multiple \\
string & string & a sequence of characters \\
real & $\mathbb{R}$ & any number in (-$\infty$, $\infty$)\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular} 
\end{center}

\noindent
The specification of \progname \ uses some derived data types: sequences, strings, and
tuples. Sequences are lists filled with elements of the same data type. Strings
are sequences of characters. Tuples contain a list of values, potentially of
different types. In addition, \progname \ uses functions, which
are defined by the data types of their inputs and outputs. Local functions are
described by giving their type signature followed by their specification.

\section{Module Decomposition}

The following table is taken directly from the Module Guide document for this project.

\section{MIS of User Profile Management Module}

\subsection{Module}
The User Profile Management Module (M1) is responsible for handling all aspects of user profile data, including account creation, authentication, and personal information management within the SweatSmart application. It ensures the secure handling of sensitive user data and provides essential functionalities for user identification and profile customization.

\subsection{Uses}
M1 uses the Data Management Module (M3) for storing and retrieving user data. It also interfaces with the Algorithm Selection Module (M7) to provide necessary user data for personalized algorithm selection and with the Input Format Module (M7) for data validation and formatting. M1 is used to store all data pertaining to the functionality of our application. From user data, to exercise data, it will encompass our database.

\section{Appendix} \label{Appendix}

\subsection{Reflection}
One limitation of our proposed solution is the accuracy of the generated workouts. The accuracy for the personalized workouts, specifically for future workouts to build upon a userâ€™s progress, relies heavily on user data, which must be both available and accurate. If a user provides inaccurate and/or incomplete data, this will lead to suboptimal workout recommendations and thus affect the results. For example, a user who does not provide feedback on their progress of completed workouts will likely see much less progress in their fitness journey, as the workout recommendations are not being modified and updated according to the userâ€™s progress. Another limitation lies in the accuracy of personalized workout exercises. By using evidence-based studies and research as the backbone of our app, we have seen that workouts are more or less prescribed based on a userâ€™s situation. \\

Other potential solutions that may not rely as much on user data and feedback are not as restricted and dependent on user input. However, these solutions will not cater to the individualâ€™s progress and thus produce suboptimal results. Therefore, choosing to have our solution rely on user feedback is the best option to provide the best results. With this in mind, we will focus on user engagement to motivate users to provide us with that data to provide them with the best recommendations, while making the process as short and simple as possible.  We have designed our application with software design principles in mind. Our module decomposition implements a high-cohesion, low-coupling approach to ensure independence.
